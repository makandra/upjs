Fast interaction feedback
=========================
  
This module marks up link elements with classes indicating that
they are currently loading (class `up-active`) or linking
to the current location (class `up-current`).

This dramatically improves the perceived speed of your user interface
by providing instant feedback for user interactions.

The classes are added and removed automatically whenever
a page fragment is added, changed or destroyed through Up.js.

How Up.js computes the current location
---------------------------------------

From Up's point of view the "current" location is either:
  
- the URL displayed in the browser window's location bar
- the source URL of a currently opened [modal dialog](/up.modal)
- the source URL of a currently opened [popup overlay](/up.popup)

A link will match the current URL if either:

- its `href` attribute matches the URL
- its `up-href` attribute matches the URL
- its `up-follow` attribute matches the URL
