Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project mostly adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


Unreleased
----------

### Compatible changes

- `up.proxy.ajax` is now available as [`up.ajax`](/up.ajax).
- `up.ajax` can now handle nested objects as `{ data }` option (used to pass form parameters).
- TODO: Document [up-keep], up:fragment:keep, up:fragment:kept


### Breaking changes

- `up.implant` has been renamed to [`up.extract`](/up.extract).


0.18.1
------

### Compatible changes

- The logging output to the developer console is now much quieter and more useful


0.18.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New UJS attribute [`[up-toggle]`](/up-toggle) to show or hide part of a form if certain options are selected or boxes are checked.
- Links can now have an optional `up-confirm` attribute. This opens a confirmation dialog with the given message
  before the link is followed or the modal/popup is opened.
- New function [`up.off`](/up.off). This unregisters an event listener previously bound with [`up.on`](/up.on).
- If a container contains more than one link, you can now set the value of the [`up-expand`](/up-expand)
  attribute to a CSS selector to define which link should be expanded.
- You can now configure a list of idempotent HTTP methods in [`up.proxy.config.safeMethods`](/up.proxy.config).
  The proxy cache will only cache idempotent requests and will clear the entire
  cache after a non-idempotent request.
- Loading modals and popups will now open if there is a fragment update between the modal/popup's
  request and response.
- [`up.follow`](/up.follow) and [`up.replace`](/up.replace) now have an option `{ failTarget }`.
  Use it to define the selector to replace if the server responds with a non-200 status code.
- [`[up-target]`](/up-target) and [`up-follow`](/up.replace) now have a modifying attribute `up-fail-target`.
  Use it to define the selector to replace if the server responds with a non-200 status code.
- New utility method [`up.util.reject`](/up.util.reject)
- New utility method [`up.util.only`](/up.util.only)
- New utility method [`up.util.except`](/up.util.except)
- Fix a bug where modals could no longer be opened on some browsers

### Breaking changes

- By default Up.js now converts `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests to `POST` requests
  that carry their original method in a form parameter named `_method`.
  This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

  Web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Sinatra are aware of the `_method` parameter and use
  its value as the method for routing.

  You can configure this behavior in [`up.proxy.config.wrapMethods`](/up.proxy.config)
  and [`up.proxy.config.wrapMethodParam`](/up.proxy.config).
- The requested selector is now sent to the server as a request header `X-Up-Target`
  (this used to be `X-Up-Selector`). If you are using `upjs-rails`, you can access it
  through `up.target` (this used to be `up.selector`).


0.17.0
------

### Compatible changes

- When used with the [Ruby on Rails unobtrusive scripting adapter](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs) (`rails_ujs.js`),
  now prevents duplicate form submission when Up.js attributes are mixed with `data-method` attributes.
- [`[up-instant]`](/up-instant) now works with modals and popups
- [`[up-expand]`](/up-expand) now works with modals and popups

### Breaking changes

- When [`up.observe`](/up.observe) is used with a delay of zero, the callback is invoked instantly (instead of
  being invoked in the next animation frame).


0.16.0
------

### Compatible changes

- You can now configure [`up.proxy.config.maxRequests`](/up.proxy.config) to limit
  the maximum number of concurrent requests. Additional
  requests are queued. This currently ignores preloading requests.

  You might find it useful to set this to `1` in full-stack integration
  tests (e.g. Selenium).
- Allow to disable animations globally with `up.motion.enabled = false`.
  This can be useful in full-stack integration tests like a Selenium test suite.
- New function [`up.motion.isEnabled`](/up.motion.isEnabled) to check if animations will be performed.
- [`up.popup.attach`](/up.popup.attach) now throws a helpful error when trying to attach a popup to a non-existing element
- New option [`up.modal.config.history`](/up.modal.config) to configure if modals change the browser URL (defaults to `true`)
- New option [`up.popup.config.history`](/up.popup.config) to configure if popup change the browser URL (defaults to `false`).
- Fix CSS for popups with a position of `"bottom-left"`.

### Breaking changes

- Popups and modals used to close automatically whenever an element behind the overlay was replaced.
  This behavior is still in effect, but only if the replacement was triggered by a link or element from
  within the popup or modal.
- Popups and modals no longer raise an error if their (hidden) overlay was closed before the
  response was received.
- Popups and modals are now compiled before they are animated.


0.15.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix an error where `up.form.config` was not published. This caused `up-bootstrap.js` to throw an error.


0.15.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New function [`up.autosubmit`](/up.autosubmit) and selector [`[up-autosubmit]`](/up-autosubmit) to
  observe a form or field and submit the form when a value changes.
- [`up.observe`](/up.observe) and [`[up-observe]`](/up-observe) can now be applied
  to `<form>` tags. The callback is run when any field in the form changes.
- New function [`up.browser.canPushState`](/up.browser.canPushState) to detect
  if the browser supports `history.pushState`.
- New function [`up.browser.canCssTransition`](/up.browser.canCssTransition) to
  detect if the browser supports animation with CSS transitions.
- New function [`up.browser.canInputEvent`](/up.browser.canInputEvent) to
  detect if the browser supports the `input` event.
- Allow to [configure a default delay](/up.form.config) for [`up.observe`](/up.observe).
- [Popups](/up.popup) now have events [`up:popup:open`](/up:popup:open),
  [`up:popup:opened`](/up:popup:opened), [`up:popup:close`](/up:popup:close)
  and [`up:popup:closed`](/up:popup:closed).
- The destructor returned by [`up.observe`](/up.observe) now properly unregisters
  event listeners.

### Breaking changes

- [`up.observe`](/up.observe) now takes the callback function as a last argument.
  The callback can now longer be passed as a `.change` option.


0.14.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Published the [up.util](/up.util) module.
  This might save you from loading something like [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/).


0.13.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Support for server-side live validation of forms
  using the [`[up-validate]`](/up-validate) selector.
- Support for [non-standard CSS selectors from jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/),
  such as [`:has`](http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/) or [`:visible`](http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/).
- Allow to refer to the current element as `&` in target selectors. This is useful
  to reference containers that contain the triggering element, e.g.
  `<a href="/path" up-target=".container:has(&)">`
- Improve automatic generation of selectors for elements when no
  explicit selector is given.
- Forms with `file` inputs will now cause forms to fall back to a standard submission without AJAX.
  In a future release we will be able to submit file inputs via AJAX.
- The [request cache](/up.proxy) now reuses responses for `body` and `html` when asked for other selectors.
- Server responses can now change the document title by including an `X-Up-Title` header.


0.12.5
------

### Compatible changes

- `a[up-target]` and `up.follow` now scroll to a #hash in the link's destination URL
- When up.replace cannot make a change in old browsers, return an unresolved promise instead of a resolved promise.


0.12.4
------

### Compatible changes

- When [morphing](/up.morph), prevent flickering caused by long repaint frames
- When [morphing](/up.morph) don't un-highlight current navigation sections in the element that is being destroyed. This makes for a smoother transition.
- Fix a bug where compositing wasn't forced properly during an animation


0.12.3
------

Refactored internals. No API changes.


0.12.2
------

### Compatible changes

- When marking links as `.up-current`, also consider the URL behind a current modal or popup to
  be the "current" URL.


### Breaking changes

- `up.bus.emit` is now [`up.emit`](http://upjs.io/up.emit/)
- When `up.first` finds no match, return `undefined` instead of `null`.


0.12.1
------

### Compatible changes

- `up.on` now returns a function that unbinds the events when called
- Fixed a bug where restoring previous scroll positions was not worked
  in situations where the same operation would also reveal the replaced element.
- Various bugfixes


0.12.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Up.js can now be used with [`jQuery.noConflict()`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/).


### Breaking changes

- Remove `up.slot`, which was poorly implemented, untested, and not much better than the `:empty` pseudo-selector
  which has great browser support
- Replaced the `up.bus.on(...)` event registry with vanilla DOM events bound to `document`. Also renamed
  events in the process.

  Instead of the old ...

      up.bus.on('fragment:ready', function($fragment) {
        ...
      };

  ... you now need to write ...

      $(document).on('up:fragment:inserted', function(event) {
        var $fragment = $(this);
        ...
      };

  ... or shorter:

      up.on('up:fragment:inserted', function(event, $fragment) {
         ...
      };
- Renamed `up.ready` to `up.hello`. This will emit an `up:event:inserted` event for the given element,
  causing it to be compiled etc.
- `up.popup.open` has been renamed to `up.popup.attach`.
- `up.modal.open` has been split into two methods `up.modal.visit(url)` and `up.modal.follow($link)`.
- `up.tooltip.open` has been renamed to `up.tooltip.attach`.
- Tooltips now escape HTML by default; To use HTML content, use an `[up-tooltip-html]` attribute instead.
- Module configurations are now simple properties like `up.layout.config` instead of methods like `up.layout.defaults(...)`.

  Instead of the old ...

      up.layout.defaults({ snap: 100 });

  ... you now need to write:

      up.layout.config.snap = 100;


0.11.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where browsers without CSS animation support would crash after an animation call
- Expose `up.error` as public API. This prints an error message to the error console and throws a new `Error` with that message.
- Fix a million bugs related to compatibility with IE9 and IE10


0.11.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Rework the scrolling implementation so we don't need to scroll elements to the top before replacing them.
- `up.ajax` now only caches responses with a status code of `200 OK`
- When a link with an `[up-close]` attribute is clicked, the link's default action will only be prevented
  if the link was actually within a modal or popup.
- When revealing an element, Up will now compute the correct element position if there are
  additional positioning contexts between the viewport and the element
- New option "top" for `up.reveal`: Whether to scroll the viewport so that the first element row aligns with
  the top edge of the viewport. Without this option, `up.reveal` scrolls as little as possible.
- Allow to animate scrolling when the `document` is the viewport.
- New `up.layout` setting `fixedRight` that contains selectors for elements that are anchored to
  the right edge of the screen. When opening a modal, these elements will be prevented from jumping
  around. If you're using `up-bootstrap.js`, this will default to `['.navbar-fixed-top', '.navbar-fixed-bottom', '.footer']`.
- Fix a bug in `upjs-rails` where the gem would fail to `include` itself in some versions
  of Ruby and Rails.


### Breaking changes

- Interactions that would result in an URL change ("pushState") now fall back to a full page load
  if Up.js was booted from a non-GET request. [More information about the reasons for this](https://github.com/makandra/upjs/commit/d81d9007aa3bfae0fca8c55a71d180d1044acae5).

  This currently works out of the box if you're using Up.js via the `upjs-rails` Rubygem.
  If you're integrating Up.js with Bower or manually, you need to have your server app
  set an `_up_request_method` cookie with the current request method on every request.


0.10.5
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where the proxy would remain busy forever if a response failed.


0.10.4
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where hovering multiple times over the same [up-preload] link would
  not trigger a new request after the cache expired


0.10.3
------

### Compatible changes

- The default viewport is now `document` instead of the `<body>` element.


0.10.2
------

### Breaking changes

- While following links and submitting forms will still reveal elements by default,
  direct calls of [`up.replace`](/up.replace) no longer do.
  This behavior can be activated using the `{ reveal: true }` option.

### Compatible changes

- Options to control scrolling and cache use for
  [`up.submit`](/up.submit),
  [`up.follow`](/up.follow),
  [`up.visit`](/up.visit),
  [`form[up-target]`](/form-up-target) and
  [`a[up-target]`](/a-up-target).


0.10.1
------

### Breaking changes

- [`up.reveal`](/up.reveal) now only reveals the first 150 pixels of an element.


0.10.0
-------

### Compatible changes

- Viewport scroll positions are saved when the URL changes and restored when the user hits the back/forward button
- Allow to link to the previous page using [`[up-back]`](/up-back)
- Allow to restore previous scroll state using [`[up-restore-scroll]`](/a-up-target)
- Instead of saying `<tag up-something="true">` you can now simply say `<tag up-something>`.
- Create this Changelog.

### Breaking changes

- The option `options.scroll` and attribute `up-scroll` have been removed. Instead you can use the
  boolean option `options.reveal` or `up-reveal` to indicate whether an element should be revealed
  within the viewport before replacement.
- The string `up.history.defaults('popTarget')` is now an array of selectors `up.history.defaults('popTargets')`


0.9.1
-----

### Compatible changes

- Change transition implementation so child elements with collapsing margins don't reposition within the animated element


0.9.0
-----

### Compatible changes

- Elements are now being [revealed](/up.reveal) within their viewport before they are updated
- Elements that are prepended or appended using `:before` or `:after` pseudo-selectors are now scrolled into view after insertion.
- New option `up.layout.defaults('snap')` lets you define a number of pixels under which Up.js will snap to the top edge of the viewport when revealing an element
- You can now make [`up.reveal`](/up.reveal) aware of fixed navigation bars blocking the viewport by setting new options `up.layout.defaults('fixedTop')` and `up.layout.defaults('fixedBottom')`.


0.8.2
-----

### Compatible changes

- [`up.reveal`](/up.reveal) can now reveal content in modals and containers with `overflow-y: scroll`.
- Changing the default configuration of an Up.js module now raises an error if a config key is unknown.
- Links linking to `"#"` are now never marked as `.up-current`.


0.8.1
-----

### Compatible chanes

- You can now include `up-bootstrap.js` and `up-bootstrap.css` to configure Up.js to play nice with Bootstrap 3.


### Breaking changes

- Like Bootstrap, the Up.js modal will now scroll the main document viewport instead of the modal dialog box.



0.8.0
-----

### Compatible changes

- Up.js will now emit [events](http://upjs.io/up.bus) `proxy:busy` and `proxy:idle` whenever it is loading or is done loading content over HTTP.
- Add an option `up.proxy.defaults('busyDelay')` to delay the `proxy:busy` event in order to prevent flickering of loading spinners.


0.7.8
------

### Compatible changes

- Now longer throws an error if the current location does not match an `up-alias` wildcard (bugfix).


0.7.7
-----

### Compatible changes

- Allow `up-alias` to match URLs by prefix (`up-alias="prefix*"`).


0.7.6
-----

### Compatible changes

- Fix what Up.js considers the current URL of a modal or popup if multiple updates change different parts of the modal or popup.
- Don't replace elements within a container that matches `.up-destroying` or `.up-ghost` (which are cloned elements for animation purposes).


0.7.5
-----

### Compatible changes
